# API Reference

The Prop-AI API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_\(HTTP\)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Prop-AI API in test mode, which doesn’t affect your live data. The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.

The Prop-AI API doesn’t support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.

The Prop-AI API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality.
